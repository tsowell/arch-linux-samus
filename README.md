### Linux kernel for Chromebook Pixel 2015 (Samus)

This repository contains quick-and-dirty patches to mainline Linux with support
for the Chromebook Pixel 2015 (Samus) borrowed from Chromium OS.  Currently the
touchpad, the touchscreen, sound, and the keyboard backlight are working.  This
is useful as a stopgap until mainline has proper support for the hardware.  The
kernel patches are in arch/linux-samus for use with other distributions, and
binary packages are available in the Releases section for Arch Linux and for
Ubuntu.

The Arch kernel package, linux-samus, is also available in the AUR.

#### Installation

##### Ubuntu

###### Install kernel packages

Download the [release tarball for
Ubuntu](https://github.com/tsowell/linux-samus/releases/download/v0.2.2/linux-samus-ubuntu-0.2.2.tar),
untar it, and install the packages:

```
$ curl -LO https://github.com/tsowell/linux-samus/releases/download/v0.2.2/linux-samus-ubuntu-0.2.2.tar
$ tar xvf linux-samus-ubuntu-0.2.2.tar
$ cd linux-samus-ubuntu-0.2.2
$ sudo dpkg -i *.deb
```

###### Edit GRUB configuration

Set the linux-samus kernel as GRUB's default:

```
sudo grub-set-default "Ubuntu, with Linux 3.19.0-11.11+samus-1-generic"
sudo update-grub
```

###### Initialize the audio device state

Reboot and then load the ALSA UCM (included in the release tarball) to
initialize the audio device state:

```
$ cd linux-samus-ubuntu-0.2.2
$ ALSA_CONFIG_UCM=ucm/ alsaucm -c bdw-rt5677 set _verb HiFi 
```

##### Arch

###### Install kernel packages

Download the [release tarball for
Arch](https://github.com/tsowell/linux-samus/releases/download/v0.2.2/linux-samus-arch-0.2.2.tar),
untar it, and install the packages:

```
$ curl -LO https://github.com/tsowell/linux-samus/releases/download/v0.2.2/linux-samus-arch-0.2.2.tar
$ tar xvf linux-samus-arch-0.2.2.tar
$ cd linux-samus-arch-0.2.2
$ sudo pacman -U *.pkg.tar.xz
```

###### Edit GRUB configuration

Generate a new grub.cfg with grub-mkconfig:

```
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

###### Configure Synaptics

To use xf86-input-synaptics with the touchpad, you'll need at least the
following in `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf`:

```
Section "InputClass"
    Identifier "touchpad"
    MatchIsTouchpad "on"
    MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"
    Driver "synaptics"
EndSection
```

Example configuration with additional features enabled
```
Section "InputClass"
	Identifier "touchpad"
	MatchIsTouchpad "on"
	MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"
	Driver "synaptics"
	Option "TapButton1" "1"
	Option "TapButton2" "3"
	Option "TapButton3" "3"
	Option "FingerLow" "5"
	Option "FingerHigh" "10"
   	Option "VertEdgeScroll" "on"
   	Option "VertTwoFingerScroll" "on"
   	Option "HorizEdgeScroll" "on"
   	Option "HorizTwoFingerScroll" "on"
EndSection
```





###### Change ALSA device order

The SoC audio device shows up as the second ALSA device, so you might want to
add this to /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf to change the order:

```
options snd_soc_rt5677 index=0
options snd_hda_intel index=1
```

###### Initialize the audio device state

Reboot and then load the ALSA UCM (included in the release tarball) to
initialize the audio device state:

```
$ cd linux-samus-arch-0.2.2
$ ALSA_CONFIG_UCM=ucm/ alsaucm -c bdw-rt5677 set _verb HiFi 
```

NOTE: If you're running from an SD card (slow), your Pixel might appear to
hang for a few minutes while it syncs to disk before rebooting.  I recommend
running "sudo sync" manually before rebooting after a lot of disk activity
(like building and installing a kernel package).

###### Issues

The master volume can be set, but not read, through the mixer interface.

#### Sound

##### Persisting state

In Arch, alsa-utils provides systemd configuration files to save and restore
the audio device state once the UCM has been applied to initialize it.  You can
manually save the state with `alsactl store`.

##### Headphone jack

Audio must be rerouted in software from the internal speakers to the headphone
jack when something is plugged in.  If you first install the UCM files by
copying the directory `common/ucm/bdw-rt5677` to `/usr/share/alsa/ucm`, you can
use, for example, `acpid` to do the routing automatically by adding this case
to `/etc/acpi/handler.sh`:

```
    jack/headphone)
        case "$3" in
            plug)
                logger "headphone plugged"
                alsaucm -c bdw-rt5677 set _verb HiFi set _enadev Headphone
                ;;
            unplug)
                logger "headphone unplugged"
                alsaucm -c bdw-rt5677 set _verb HiFi set _disdev Headphone
                ;;
            *)
                logger "ACPI action undefined: $3"
                ;;
        esac
        ;;
```

#### Keyboard backlight

Brightness can be controlled through /sys/class/leds/chromeos::kbd_backlight.


By default users other than root are not permitted to write to `/sys/class/leds/chromeos::kbd_backlight/brightness` so we must first change the file's permissions.
```
chown $USER:wheel /sys/class/leds/chromeos::kbd_backlight/brightness 
```

We can then use a script to incrementally increase or decrease the keyboard backlight. Save the following file to your home directory:`~/.config/kb-backlight.sh`


```
#!/bin/bash

# ~/.config/kb-backlight.sh

step=10
file=/sys/class/leds/chromeos::kbd_backlight/brightness

case "$1" in
    -i|--increase) ((val = +step));;
    -d|--decrease) ((val = -step));;
esac

if !((val)); then
    echo "Increase or decrease screen brighness"
    echo "Usage: ${0##*/} --increase | --decrease"
    exit
fi

read -r cur < "$file"    
((val = cur + val))

if ((val <   0)); then ((val =   0)); fi
if ((val > 100)); then ((val = 100)); fi

printf '%d' "$val" > "$file"

printf ""$val"\n"
```

Make the file executable
```
chmod +x $HOME/.config/kb-backlight.sh
```

Now you can now control the keyboard backlight with the following two commands. Bind each command to your keyboard with your preferred program/method.

```
$HOME/.config/kb-backlight.sh --increase
```
```
$HOME/.config/kb-backlight.sh --decrease
```

###Applying Patches

#####Grub
<!---
Taken directly from the Arch Wiki: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Kernel_parameters#GRUB
-->

Edit `/etc/default/grub` and append your kernel options to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT line:

```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"
```

```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash CONFIG_BACKLIGHT_CHROMEOS_KEYBOARD"
```

And then automatically re-generate the grub.cfg file with:

```
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```
